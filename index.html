    <h1>My Mission</h1>
    </br>

    <div class="issues">
      <h3>Freedom</h3>
      <p>As candidate for Constable, I feel it is my duty to let the people live
      their lives. Did you know that, on average, people spend 18 years as children?
      I know, mind boggling! I have done extensive research, and found this to be
      a self evident truth. Based on that truth, I believe people shouldn't need
      someone watching over their backs all the time. America is about freedom,
      and I pledge to involve myself in your lives as little as possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issues">
      <h3>Self-Reliance</h3>
      <p>We live in a time of dependency. Well my goal is to ween you of that need.
      Don't ask me for stuff. Don't complain to me. Don't beg for help. I'll save
      you some time and say, "I'm busy." Leave me alone. I have work to do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issues">
      <h3>Horse Thieves</h3>
      <p>Lexington has an epidemic. People are walking downtown with ice cream in their back
      pocket. They are stealing my horses, your horses... our good ol' Kentucky horses.
      I will not ask for help, since that is not my philosophy. I will bury my head
      in the sand, so to speak, and root this evil out. All other issues? Yeah, those
      are non-issues. Trust me. Elect Joe Hexpack, and I will purge this corruption.</p>
